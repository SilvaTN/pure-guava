            <p id="video-text">Our most popular product is the "Push Th' Little Daisies", a song produced by Gene and Dean Ween using pure guava. It was played and recorded with guava instruments inside a studio made out of guava that utilised only guava-based technology. As preparation, in the week leading up to the recording, Dean and Gene consumed nothing but guava. In an interview, Gene stated, "I regret doing that." Dean, on the other hand, said, "Although I probably will never do it again, I had fun! I really had fun with my best friend, Dean."</p>

                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>A long time ago me and my brother Jyle were hitchhiking down a long and lonesome road. All of a sudden, there shone a shiny boongish, in the middle of the road. And they said, "Give me the best range of guava products in the world, or I'll eat your souls." Well, me and Jyle, we looked at each other, and we each said, "Okay." And we gave them the entire contents of our guava backpack. They just so happened to be the best guava products in the world. This encounter inspired us to market the guava products that pleased the boongish so much, and people have responded very positively, including some famous celebrities. Dave Ghrol, Foo Fighters founder, has stated that our products are, "The best, the best, the best," and that, "it's times like these we learn to love [guava] again."</p>

                <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
                <p>We do what we do because we like praise and money. We gain a lot of both those things by selling our superb guava proudcts, so we are gonna keep doing that until we stop getting the amount of praise and money that makes us content. If that happens, we will probably just sell everything in a garage sale or something.</p>
